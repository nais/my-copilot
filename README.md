- **User Information**: Displays user information such as name, email, and groups.

## Integrations

- **GitHub API**: Interacts with the GitHub API to manage Copilot subscriptions and retrieve user details.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling the application.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 22 or higher)
- npm (version 7 or higher)
- A GitHub App with the necessary permissions

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables:

```env
GITHUB_APP_ID=your_github_app_id
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=your_github_app_private_key
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=your_github_app_installation_id
AZURE_APP_CLIENT_ID=your_azure_app_client_id
AZURE_OPENID_CONFIG_JWKS_URI=your_azure_openid_config_jwks_uri
AZURE_OPENID_CONFIG_ISSUER=your_azure_openid_config_issuer
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Building and Testing

To build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/build-deploy.yaml`. The application is deployed to the NAIS platform.

### Group Access

This project uses group access to control who can use GitHub Copilot. The groups are defined in the `app.yaml` file under the `azure.application.claims.groups` section. To give more groups access, you need to add their IDs to this section.

Example:
```yaml
azure:
  application:
    enabled: true
    tenant: nav.no
    allowAllUsers: true
    claims:
      groups:
        - id: 48120347-8582-4329-8673-7beb3ed6ca06
        - id: 76e9ee7e-2cd1-4814-b199-6c0be007d7b4
        - id: eb5c5556-6c9a-4e54-83fc-f70cae25358d
        # Add more group IDs here
```
